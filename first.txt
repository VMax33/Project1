We're going to type a few instructions here
12:33
and the first one that I want to do is
12:35
git init and I'm going to call this project1.
12:38
When I've typed git init project1, I have done something pretty impressive
12:43
which is to instantaneously create a local repository
12:47
but with no server
12:49
or any daemon running in the background,
12:52
there's nothing in the background.
12:54
It simply used the file system to create a top level directory called project1
13:00
and then a nested folder beneath it called .git.
